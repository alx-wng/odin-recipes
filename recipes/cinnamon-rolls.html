                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <h4>Dough</h4>
                        <li>
                            Whisk <strong>3/4 cups of whole milk</strong> with <strong>1/4 cup 
                            of all-purpose flour</strong> in saucepan until smooth. Place saucepan 
                            over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is 
                            thickened and whisk lines are visible on bottom of pan, about 2 minutes. 
                            Scrape tangzhong into the bowl of a stand mixer and let cool.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add <strong>1 large egg, 1 1/4 oz instant yeast, 1/3 cup of granulated 
                            sugar, 1 tbsp salt,</strong> and remaining <strong>1 1/2 cups whole milk</strong>
                            to tangzhong and whisk to combine. Add remaining <strong>5 1/2 cups of all-purpose
                            flour</strong>. Fit bowl onto stand mixer; fit mixer with dough hook attachment.
                            Mix on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-low and 
                            mix, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally, until dough is smooth and elastic, 
                            18-24 minutes.Pinch off a golf-ball-size piece of dough and stretch between your 
                            fingers as thin as possible without breaking. If you can see light through the 
                            dough, it's ready. If not, continue mixing a few more minutes, then try again.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add <strong>1/2 cup room temperature unsalted butter, cut into pieces</strong>, 
                            to dough and mix on medium speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Continue 
                            mixing until dough pulls away cleanly from sides of bowl and is no longer tacky 
                            to the touch, 5-7 minutes longer. Remove bowl from mixer and cover with a damp 
                            kitchen towel. Let sit in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 60-90 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <h4>Filling</h4>
                        <li>
                            While the dough is rising, cook <strong>1/2 cup unsalted butter</strong> in a 
                            small saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until butter foams and 
                            milk solids turn dark amber, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a heatproof bowl and 
                            let cool slightly. Add <strong>1 cup dark brown sugar, 2 tbsp ground cinnamon, 
                            2 tbsp heavy cream, and 1/2 tsp salt</strong> to butter and mix to combine.
                        </li>
                        <h4>Icing and Assembly</h4>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Butter</strong> two 9-inch cake pans. Punch down dough and transfer to 
                            a lightly <strong>floured</strong> surface. Stretch dough into a rough rectangle; 
                            if dough feels stiff, let sit 5-10 minutes to allow gluten to relax. Arrange 
                            dough with short side facing you and roll out to a 24 x 13 inch rectangle. 
                            Spread filling over dough in an even layer. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Starting at edge closest to you, tightly roll up dough into a log; roll log seam 
                            side down. Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim ends of 
                            log; discard. Using serrated knife or, preferably, unflavored dental floss, cut 
                            log in half crosswise, then cut each half into 6 equal rounds. (If using dental 
                            floss, slide floss underneath dough, then cross over top and pull ends through.) 
                            Nestle 6 rounds, cut side down, in each prepared cake pan. Cover with damp kitchen 
                            towels and let sit in a warm spot until doubled in volume, about 30-50 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350Â°. Bake rolls until golden on top 
                            and puffed (don't be alarmed if they rise dramatically in the center), 25-30 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium speed or a whisk, beat <strong>4 tbsp 
                            room temperature unsalted butter,</strong> and <strong>8 oz room temperature cream 
                            cheese,</strong> in a large bowl, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, until 
                            combined. Add <strong>1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tbsp heavy cream, 1 tsp lemon 
                            zest,</strong> and <strong>1/4 tsp salt</strong> and beat until mixture is smooth 
                            and sugar is incorporated. Taste and beat in more powdered sugar if desired. Thin 
                            with more cream as needed, a teaspoonful at a time, until frosting is thick but 
                            spreadable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Let cinnamon rolls cool in pan 5 minutes; spread frosting over.
                        </li>
